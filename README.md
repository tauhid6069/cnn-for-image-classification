## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate deep learning models for image classification. The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation  
- Neural network design and training  
- Model evaluation with accuracy and loss curves  
- Experimentation with different hyperparameters  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Load and preprocess image dataset  
- Build CNN models with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Train and validate the model on image data  
- Plot training curves (loss/accuracy)  
- Evaluate model performance

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
This project uses the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (available in `tensorflow.keras.datasets`).  
The dataset contains 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.  
It is automatically downloaded when running the notebook.
